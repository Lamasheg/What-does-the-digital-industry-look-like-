## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

- There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  This project is built using Anaconda(1.9.12) Jupyter notebook (6.0.3), Python versions 3.

- Libraries used:

    `pandas`

    `numpy`

    `matplotlib`
    
    `sklearn.linear_model/LinearRegression`
    
    `sklearn.model_selection/train_test_split`
    
    `sklearn.metrics/r2_score, mean_squared_error`
    
## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

I was interestested in exploring the Stack Overflow data from 2017 to get insight into:

1. What is the most popular development type in the industry?

2. What are mostly used Frameworks, Platforms and IDEs?

3. Since Freelancers have higher rates of job satisfaction (based on the data), What is the distribution of freelancers in terms of: Gender, Country, Development type, Development Methodology, and what are their views on education?

4. What are the chances that a developer would contribute to open source? (based on 2017 data)

5. Based on our data how can we predict rates of job satisfaction? (based on 2017 data)


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

- one python file showcase work related to the above questions.  The notebook is fully detailed and easy to go through, markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the analysis process.

- data file and schema from stack overflow

## Results<a name="results"></a>

1. 35% of developers around the world practice web development, which means that web development leads the indusrty.

2. Node.js, AngularJs,Â .NET Core are the most used frameworks around the world; Windows Desktop, Linux Desktop, Amazon Services (AWS) are the most used platforms           for development; and Visual Studio, Notepad++, Vim are the most used IDEs.

3. Freelancers have the highest rates of job satisfaction, 94% of them are males, 15% are from the United States, most of them are web developers who follow agile and scrum methodologies. Most freelancers believe that studying Official Documentation, and Stack Overflow Q&A are enough to learn the skill.

4. Using the dataset to predict whether a developer would contribute to open source failed.

5. The data can be used to predict Job Satisfaction.
